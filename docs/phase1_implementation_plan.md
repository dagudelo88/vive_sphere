# Implementation Plan for Phase 1: Architecture Design and Backend Foundation

**Objective**: Establish the foundational architecture and backend components for the ViveSphere Bot Manager system, focusing on a microservices-based design, core service setup, and initial frameworks for key functionalities as outlined in the PRD.

## Step 1: Define Microservices Architecture
- **Goal**: Identify and document the boundaries and responsibilities of each microservice to ensure modularity and scalability.
- **Detailed Actions**:
  1. **Identify Core Microservices**: Based on the PRD, define the following initial microservices for Phase 1:
     - **Authentication Microservice**: Handles user login, session management, and token issuance (JWT).
     - **Bot Manager Microservice**: Manages bot creation, operations, and integration with X platform API.
     - **Configuration/Settings Microservice**: Manages application settings and roles, avoiding hardcoded values.
     - **Logging System Microservice**: Captures and stores logs for user activity and debugging.
     - **Secure Bot Data Storage Microservice**: Securely stores bot credentials and sensitive data.
  2. **Define Responsibilities**: Document the Single Responsibility Principle for each microservice:
     - Authentication: User authentication, session management, token validation.
     - Bot Manager: Bot creation, management, X API interactions.
     - Configuration/Settings: Centralized configuration management, role assignments.
     - Logging: Log collection, categorization, storage.
     - Secure Bot Data: Encrypted storage and access control for bot data.
  3. **Design Communication**: Specify communication protocols:
     - Use REST APIs for synchronous communication between services (e.g., Authentication to Bot Manager for access validation).
     - Plan for asynchronous communication using message queues (RabbitMQ or Kafka) for tasks like logging or bot actions.
  4. **Document Architecture**: Create a detailed architecture document in `docs/architecture_design.md` with:
     - List of microservices and their responsibilities.
     - Interaction flowchart (update the Mermaid diagram from PRD to reflect Phase 1 focus).
     - Communication protocols and data flow.
- **Tools and Configurations**:
  - Use Markdown for documentation.
  - Reference PRD sections 3.1 (Microservices-Based Architecture) and 3.5 (Scalability and Future-Proofing) for guidelines on modularity and Kubernetes orchestration.
- **Variables**:
  - `microservices_list`: Array of objects with keys `name`, `responsibility`, `communication_type` (REST or async).
  - `architecture_doc_path`: String, set to `docs/architecture_design.md`.

## Step 2: Design API Contracts for Microservices
- **Goal**: Establish well-defined API contracts for inter-service communication to ensure consistency and reliability.
- **Detailed Actions**:
  1. **Define Endpoints**: For each microservice, specify REST API endpoints:
     - **Authentication Microservice**:
       - `POST /api/v1/auth/login`: Parameters: `username`, `password`; Returns: JWT token.
       - `GET /api/v1/auth/validate`: Parameters: `token`; Returns: Validation status.
     - **Bot Manager Microservice**:
       - `POST /api/v1/bots/create`: Parameters: `bot_name`, `credentials`; Returns: Bot ID.
       - `GET /api/v1/bots/list`: Parameters: `user_id`; Returns: List of bots.
     - **Configuration/Settings Microservice**:
       - `GET /api/v1/config/settings`: Parameters: `service_name`; Returns: Configuration data.
       - `POST /api/v1/config/update`: Parameters: `settings_data`; Returns: Update status.
     - **Logging System Microservice**:
       - `POST /api/v1/logs/submit`: Parameters: `log_type`, `log_data`; Returns: Submission status.
     - **Secure Bot Data Storage Microservice**:
       - `POST /api/v1/botdata/store`: Parameters: `bot_id`, `data`; Returns: Storage status.
       - `GET /api/v1/botdata/retrieve`: Parameters: `bot_id`; Returns: Encrypted data.
  2. **Specify Data Formats**: Use JSON for request/response payloads, adhering to OpenAPI/Swagger standards for documentation.
  3. **Versioning**: Implement API versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/`) for backward compatibility as per PRD section 3.5.
  4. **Security**: Define authentication requirements (JWT tokens) for each endpoint to ensure secure access.
  5. **Document Contracts**: Create an API specification document in `docs/api_contracts.md` or use a tool like Swagger UI for interactive documentation.
- **Tools and Configurations**:
  - Use OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation.

- **Variables**:
  - `api_endpoints`: Object mapping microservice names to arrays of endpoint definitions (method, path, parameters, response).
  - `api_doc_path`: String, set to `docs/api_contracts.md`.

## Step 3: Set Up Python Backend for Core Microservices
- **Goal**: Develop the initial backend structure for core microservices using Python, focusing on FastAPI for performance.
- **Detailed Actions**:
  1. **Project Structure**: Create a directory structure for microservices under `backend/`:
     - `backend/authentication/`
     - `backend/bot_manager/`
     - `backend/configuration/`
     - `backend/logging/`
     - `backend/secure_bot_data/`
  2. **Initialize FastAPI Apps**: For each microservice, create a `main.py` file with a basic FastAPI setup:
     - Example for `backend/authentication/main.py`:
       ```python
       from fastapi import FastAPI
       app = FastAPI(title="Authentication Microservice", version="1.0.0")
       @app.post("/api/v1/auth/login")
       async def login(username: str, password: str):
           # Placeholder for authentication logic
           return {"token": "placeholder_jwt"}
       ```
  3. **Install Dependencies**: Define a `requirements.txt` for each microservice with necessary libraries:
     - `fastapi`, `uvicorn` (for running the server), `PyJWT` (for token management), `SQLAlchemy` (for database access), `loguru` (for logging).
  4. **Database Setup**: Use SQLite for development as per PRD section 3.4:
     - Create a `db/` directory for each microservice to store SQLite databases (e.g., `backend/authentication/db/auth.db`).
     - Initialize SQLAlchemy models for basic tables (e.g., Users for Authentication, Bots for Bot Manager).
  5. **Configuration Management**: Implement configuration loading to avoid hardcoded values (PRD section 3.7):
     - Create a `config/` directory with YAML files (e.g., `config/auth.yaml` for Authentication settings).
     - Use `PyYAML` to load configurations and `python-dotenv` for environment variables.
     - Example `config/auth.yaml`:
       ```yaml
       database:
         path: "db/auth.db"
       jwt:
         secret: "placeholder_secret"
         expiry: 3600
       ```
  6. **Basic Error Handling**: Add error handling middleware in FastAPI for robustness (PRD section 3.6).
- **Tools and Configurations**:
  - Python 3.9+ for development.
  - FastAPI framework for API development.
  - SQLite for initial database setup.
  - Reference PRD sections 3.2 (Backend Python) and 3.7 (Centralized Configuration Management).

  2. **Configuration**: Create a configuration file for the gateway in `infrastructure/api_gateway/`:
     - Define routing rules to map external requests to internal microservice endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/auth/*` to Authentication service).
     - Set up authentication plugins to validate JWT tokens before forwarding requests.
     - Configure rate limiting to prevent abuse (e.g., 100 requests/minute per client).
  3. **Docker Setup**: Create a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for the API Gateway to ensure consistency across environments:
     - Example `docker-compose.yml` snippet:
       ```yaml
       services:
         api-gateway:
           image: kong:latest
           ports:
             - "8000:8000"
           environment:

     - Set up connection parameters (host, port, credentials) using environment variables for security.
  3. **Docker Setup**: Create Docker configurations for the message queue:
     - Example `docker-compose.yml` snippet for RabbitMQ:
       ```yaml
       services:
         rabbitmq:
           image: rabbitmq:3-management
           ports:
             - "5672:5672"
             - "15672:15672"
       ```
  4. **Integration**: Plan integration points in microservices (e.g., Logging Microservice publishes to `log_queue`, Bot Manager consumes from `bot_action_queue`).
