# CI/CD Pipeline Setup Planning for ViveSphere Bot Manager - Phase 1

**Objective**: Document the planning and setup process for a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline in Phase 1 of the ViveSphere Bot Manager system, automating testing, building, and deployment of microservices to ensure rapid and reliable delivery.

## Overview

A CI/CD pipeline is essential for automating the testing, building, and deployment processes of the ViveSphere Bot Manager system, aligning with the scalability and future-proofing goals outlined in the PRD (section 3.5). In Phase 1, the focus is on planning the pipeline to support the core microservices and infrastructure components. This document outlines the selection of tools, workflow definition, and integration strategy for the CI/CD pipeline.

## Selection of CI/CD Tool

- **Chosen Tool**: GitHub Actions
  - **Rationale**: GitHub Actions is selected for its seamless integration with GitHub repositories, ease of use, and extensive marketplace of pre-built actions for common tasks like testing, building Docker images, and deploying to Kubernetes. It supports the automation needs specified in the PRD and offers a generous free tier for open-source or small-scale projects, making it cost-effective for Phase 1. Additionally, it provides native support for matrix testing and parallel workflows, which will be beneficial for testing multiple microservices.
  - **Alternative**: Jenkins was considered as an alternative due to its flexibility and wide adoption in enterprise environments, but GitHub Actions was preferred for its simplicity, cloud-hosted nature (reducing infrastructure management overhead), and direct integration with the project's version control system.

## Workflow Definition

The CI/CD pipeline configuration will be stored in the `infrastructure/ci_cd/` directory, with workflow files located in `.github/workflows/` if using GitHub Actions. The pipeline will be designed to handle building, testing, and deploying microservices and infrastructure components. The following workflow stages are planned:

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
  - **Trigger**: On every `push` or `pull_request` to the `main` branch or feature branches.
  - **Steps**:
    1. **Checkout Code**: Use `actions/checkout@v3` to fetch the latest code from the repository.
    2. **Set Up Environment**: Install Python (e.g., using `actions/setup-python@v4`) and dependencies for each microservice from their respective `requirements.txt` files.
    3. **Run Unit Tests**: Execute unit tests for each microservice using `pytest` to validate individual functions and endpoints.
       - **Command**: `pytest backend/[microservice]/tests/ -v --cov=backend/[microservice]` (assuming test directories are set up).
       - **Coverage**: Aim for at least 80% code coverage, with results reported in the workflow logs.
    4. **Run Integration Tests**: Test interactions between microservices using `pytest` with mock servers or temporary containers if feasible.
       - **Command**: `pytest integration_tests/ -v` (to be defined in a separate test suite).
    5. **Linting and Static Analysis**: Use `flake8` for linting and `bandit` for security analysis to enforce code quality and prevent hardcoded values, aligning with PRD section 3.6.
       - **Command**: `flake8 backend/ docs/` and `bandit -r backend/`.
    6. **Build Docker Images**: Build Docker images for each microservice if tests pass, using Dockerfiles (to be created in each microservice directory).
       - **Command**: `docker build -t vive-sphere/[microservice]:latest backend/[microservice]/`.
    7. **Report Results**: Upload test results, coverage reports, and linting issues as artifacts or comments on pull requests for visibility.

- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**:
  - **Trigger**: On successful CI completion for `push` to `main` branch or manual approval for production deployments.
  - **Steps**:
    1. **Push Docker Images**: Push built Docker images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR) for deployment.
       - **Command**: `docker push vive-sphere/[microservice]:latest` (requires authentication setup in GitHub Secrets).
    2. **Deploy to Kubernetes**: Deploy updated images to a Kubernetes cluster (local `minikube` for development, cloud-based in future phases) using `kubectl` or Helm.
       - **Command**: `kubectl apply -f infrastructure/kubernetes/[microservice]-deployment.yaml` or use a Helm chart for parameterized deployments.
    3. **Verify Deployment**: Run a smoke test or health check post-deployment to confirm services are operational.
       - **Command**: `curl http://[api-gateway]:8000/api/v1/auth/health` (assuming health endpoints are implemented).
    4. **Rollback on Failure**: Plan for automatic rollback to the previous image version if deployment or health checks fail, using Kubernetes rolling updates.
    5. **Notify Stakeholders**: Send notifications (e.g., via Slack or email) on deployment success or failure using GitHub Actions notifications.

- **Environment Separation**:
  - Define separate workflows or branches for development, staging, and production environments to prevent untested code from reaching production.
  - Use GitHub Environments to enforce approval gates for production deployments, ensuring manual review if needed.

## Configuration Files

- **Workflow File**: Create a primary workflow file named `ci-cd.yml` in `.github/workflows/` for GitHub Actions.
  - **Example Structure**:
    ```yaml
    name: CI/CD Pipeline for ViveSphere Bot Manager
    on:
      push:
        branches: [ main, develop ]
      pull_request:
        branches: [ main, develop ]
    jobs:
      ci:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3
          - name: Set up Python
            uses: actions/setup-python@v4
            with:
              python-version: '3.9'
          - name: Install Dependencies
            run: |
              pip install -r backend/authentication/requirements.txt
              # Repeat for other microservices
          - name: Run Unit Tests
            run: |
              pytest backend/authentication/tests/ -v --cov=backend/authentication
              # Repeat for other microservices
          - name: Run Linting
            run: flake8 backend/ docs/
          - name: Run Security Analysis
            run: bandit -r backend/
          - name: Build Docker Images
            run: |
              docker build -t vive-sphere/authentication:latest backend/authentication/
              # Repeat for other microservices
      cd:
        needs: ci
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3
          - name: Login to Docker Hub
            uses: docker/login-action@v2
            with:
              username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
              password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
          - name: Push Docker Images
            run: |
              docker push vive-sphere/authentication:latest
              # Repeat for other microservices
          - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
            run: |
              kubectl apply -f infrastructure/kubernetes/auth-deployment.yaml
              # Repeat for other microservices
    ```

- **Secrets Management**: Store sensitive data like Docker Hub credentials or Kubernetes cluster access tokens in GitHub Secrets for secure access during workflows.

## Integration with Development Workflow

- **Branching Strategy**: Adopt a Git branching model like GitFlow, with `main` for production-ready code, `develop` for integration, and feature branches for ongoing work. CI runs on all branches, while CD is restricted to `main` or `develop` with approval.
- **Pull Request Process**: Require passing CI checks (tests, linting) before merging pull requests to `develop` or `main`, enforcing code quality.
- **Testing**: Integrate all test suites (unit, integration) into the CI pipeline, with results influencing deployment decisions to prevent broken code from reaching production.

## Future Considerations

- **Advanced Deployment Strategies**: Plan for blue-green deployments or canary releases in future phases to minimize downtime and risk during updates.
- **Helm Charts**: Transition to Helm for managing Kubernetes deployments with parameterized configurations for different environments.
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Extend the pipeline to handle multiple environments (development, staging, production) with distinct Kubernetes clusters or namespaces.
- **Monitoring**: Integrate pipeline status with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus alerts for failed builds or deployments) as per PRD section 3.6.

This document provides the planning framework for the CI/CD pipeline setup in Phase 1, preparing for automated testing, building, and deployment of microservices as implementation progresses.
