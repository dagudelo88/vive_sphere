# Kubernetes Orchestration Planning for ViveSphere Bot Manager - Phase 1

**Objective**: Document the planning and setup process for Kubernetes orchestration in Phase 1 of the ViveSphere Bot Manager system, ensuring scalability, load balancing, and fault tolerance for microservices deployment.

## Overview

Kubernetes is selected as the orchestration platform for the ViveSphere Bot Manager system to manage microservices, ensuring scalability, load balancing, and fault tolerance as outlined in the PRD (section 3.1). In Phase 1, the focus is on planning the Kubernetes setup to support the core microservices (Authentication, Bot Manager, Configuration/Settings, Logging, and Secure Bot Data Storage) and infrastructure components (API Gateway, Message Queue). This document outlines the planned Kubernetes resources, scaling policies, and deployment strategy for future implementation.

## Kubernetes Resources

The Kubernetes configuration files will be stored in the `infrastructure/kubernetes/` directory. These files will define the necessary resources for deploying and managing microservices in a cluster. The following resources are planned for each microservice and infrastructure component:

- **Deployments**:
  - Define the desired state for each microservice, including the number of replicas, container image, and environment variables.
  - Example file: `auth-deployment.yaml` for the Authentication Microservice.
  - **Structure**:
    - Specify container images (e.g., custom-built images for microservices or official images like `kong:latest` for API Gateway).
    - Set resource limits and requests (CPU, memory) to ensure efficient resource allocation.
    - Include readiness and liveness probes to check service health (e.g., HTTP endpoint checks on `/health` if implemented).

- **Services**:
  - Expose microservices internally within the cluster for inter-service communication.
  - Example file: `auth-service.yaml` for the Authentication Microservice.
  - **Structure**:
    - Use `ClusterIP` type for internal access (e.g., `authentication:8000` for other services to reach it).
    - Map service ports to container ports as defined in the microservice setup (e.g., port 8000 for FastAPI apps).

- **ConfigMaps**:
  - Store non-sensitive configuration data for microservices to avoid hardcoded values, aligning with PRD section 3.7.
  - Example file: `auth-configmap.yaml` for the Authentication Microservice.
  - **Structure**:
    - Include configuration data from YAML files (e.g., `database.path` from `auth.yaml`) to be mounted as environment variables or files in containers.

- **Secrets**:
  - Plan for storing sensitive data (e.g., database credentials, JWT secrets) using Kubernetes Secrets, to be referenced by Deployments.
  - Example file: `auth-secrets.yaml` for the Authentication Microservice.
  - **Structure**:
    - Encode sensitive values as base64 strings or integrate with secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) in future phases.

- **Ingress** (for API Gateway):
  - Plan an Ingress resource to expose the API Gateway (Kong) externally, routing traffic to internal services based on path rules.
  - Example file: `api-gateway-ingress.yaml`.
  - **Structure**:
    - Define path-based routing (e.g., `/api/v1/auth/*` to Authentication Service via Kong).
    - Configure TLS for secure external access in production.

## Scaling Policies

Kubernetes auto-scaling will be configured to handle load increases dynamically, aligning with PRD section 3.5 on horizontal scaling:

- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**:
  - Set up HPA for each microservice Deployment to scale the number of pods based on CPU or memory usage.
  - **Parameters**:
    - Target CPU utilization: 70% (adjustable based on performance testing).
    - Minimum replicas: 2 (to ensure fault tolerance with at least two instances).
    - Maximum replicas: 5 (initial cap to control resource usage, adjustable in future phases).
  - Example: For Authentication Microservice, scale pods if average CPU usage exceeds 70% across all running pods.

- **Cluster Autoscaler** (Future Consideration):
  - Plan for Cluster Autoscaler integration in production to scale the number of nodes in the cluster based on pod scheduling needs, ensuring resource availability during high load.

## Deployment Strategy

The deployment strategy for Kubernetes in Phase 1 focuses on planning and preparing for local or cloud-based cluster setup:

1. **Local Development Cluster**:
   - Use tools like `minikube` or `kind` (Kubernetes in Docker) for local development and testing of Kubernetes configurations.
   - **Steps**:
     - Install `minikube` or `kind` on the development environment.
     - Start a local cluster (e.g., `minikube start`).
     - Apply Kubernetes manifests from `infrastructure/kubernetes/` using `kubectl apply -f <file>.yaml`.
     - Test microservice accessibility via internal services or Ingress within the local cluster.

2. **Cloud-Based Cluster (Future Phases)**:
   - Plan for deployment on managed Kubernetes services like AWS EKS, Google GKE, or Azure AKS for production environments.
   - **Steps** (Planned):
     - Provision a Kubernetes cluster on the chosen cloud provider.
     - Configure cluster networking (e.g., VPC, subnets) for secure internal communication.
     - Deploy microservices and infrastructure components using the same manifests, adjusted for cloud-specific settings (e.g., storage classes, load balancers).

3. **Deployment Workflow**:
   - **Build Images**: Build Docker images for each microservice using Dockerfiles (to be created in each microservice directory) and push to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).
   - **Apply Configurations**: Apply Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets to the cluster using `kubectl`.
   - **Verify Deployment**: Check pod status (`kubectl get pods`), service accessibility (`kubectl get svc`), and logs (`kubectl logs <pod-name>`) to ensure successful deployment.
   - **Test End-to-End**: Test API endpoints through the API Gateway Ingress to confirm routing and functionality.

## Configuration Management

- **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Plan for separate ConfigMaps or Helm values files for different environments (development, staging, production) to load configurations dynamically based on an environment identifier (e.g., `ENV=prod`), as per PRD section 3.7.
- **Secret Management**: Use Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive data in Phase 1, with a future plan to integrate with external secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for enhanced security.

## Monitoring and Logging

- **Integration with Prometheus and Grafana**: Plan to deploy Prometheus and Grafana in the cluster for monitoring Kubernetes resources and microservice metrics, aligning with PRD section 3.6.
  - **Prometheus**: Collect metrics from microservices (if they expose `/metrics` endpoints) and Kubernetes components.
  - **Grafana**: Visualize metrics with dashboards for system health, pod status, and resource usage.
- **Logging**: Ensure microservice logs are accessible via `kubectl logs` and plan for integration with the Logging System Microservice to centralize logs within the cluster.

## Future Considerations

- **High Availability**: Configure multi-zone deployments and pod disruption budgets in production to ensure high availability and minimal downtime during updates or failures.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate Kubernetes deployments with the CI/CD pipeline (planned in Step 8) using tools like Helm or Kustomize for automated rollouts and rollbacks.
- **Network Policies**: Implement Kubernetes NetworkPolicies to control traffic between pods for enhanced security in future phases.
- **Storage**: Plan for persistent volume claims (PVCs) with appropriate storage classes for databases and message queues to ensure data persistence across pod restarts.
